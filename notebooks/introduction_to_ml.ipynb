    "> Machine learning is a field of Artificial intelligence whose aim is to create computer programs that can learn from data and experience.\n",

    "## Types of machine learning\n",
    " 1. Supervised Learning: In this type of learning, example inputs are shown together with the correct output.\n",
    ">Most popular algorithms here are regression(predicting a continuous value) and classification(predicting a discrete value).\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Unsupervised Learning: In this case we are given unlabelled data, and the model should get insights from this data(cluster, group)."
